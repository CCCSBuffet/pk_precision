# Float and Double are approximations

This program demonstrates the float and double are approximations of the real numbers.

This is accomplished by enumerating the reciprocals of the integers from 1 through 99 and multiplying said integer. The result
should always be 1.0. Anytime the product does not test as equal to 1.0, its true value is printed out.
